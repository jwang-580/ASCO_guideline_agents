When should genetic testing for cancer predisposition genes beyond BRCA1/2 be considered?,"Testing should be offered if high penetrance genes (e.g., PALB2, TP53) could influence therapy, surgical decisions, or family risk assessment.","After reviewing the information provided, I can provide a clear answer to your question about when genetic testing for cancer predisposition genes beyond BRCA1/2 should be considered:

Genetic testing for cancer predisposition genes beyond BRCA1/2 should be considered in the following situations:

For high-penetrance genes (PALB2, TP53, PTEN, STK11, CDH1):
- When results could inform medical therapy decisions
- When results may influence surgical decision-making
- When results help refine estimates of second primary cancer risk
- When results inform family risk assessment
- When the patient has personal or family history suggesting these specific syndromes

For moderate-penetrance genes:
- When the patient is already undergoing BRCA1/2 testing
- When results may inform risks of second primary cancers
- When results may inform family risk assessment

The decision to test for genes beyond BRCA1/2 should be made thoughtfully, considering:
- The patient's personal and family history
- Consultation with providers experienced in clinical cancer genetics
- The ability to properly interpret results

It's worth noting that testing for high-penetrance genes beyond BRCA1/2 is unusual unless specifically suggested by personal or family history, and that variants in moderate-penetrance genes currently lack direct treatment implications for the index breast cancer case.

How should patients with variants of uncertain significance (VUS) be managed after genetic testing?,VUS should not alter management; patients should be followed up for reclassification and informed that reclassification is possible.,"I've reviewed the information about managing patients with variants of uncertain significance (VUS) after genetic testing. Here's a comprehensive answer:

# Management of Patients with VUS Results

When patients receive a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) result from genetic testing, the following approach should be taken:

## Primary Management Principles
1. **No Changes to Medical Management**: 
   - VUS results should NOT alter medical management decisions
   - Screening and risk reduction recommendations should be based solely on personal and family history, not the VUS

2. **Patient Education**:
   - Explain that VUS findings are common, especially with multi-gene panel testing
   - Inform patients that VUS may be reclassified in the future as either benign or pathogenic
   - Ensure patients understand the uncertainty associated with these results

3. **Follow-up Process**:
   - Establish a system for periodic follow-up to check for reclassification
   - Annual follow-up is suggested as reasonable in most cases
   - Clearly document the uncertain nature of the finding in medical records

## Additional Considerations
- **Genetic Expert Consultation**: Make consultation with clinical cancer genetics specialists available
- **Family Testing**: Testing family members specifically for a VUS is not recommended for clinical purposes (with rare exceptions)
- **Research Participation**: Consider referring patients to research studies focused on variant classification
- **Racial/Ethnic Awareness**: Acknowledge that VUS are more common in racial and ethnic minorities compared to non-Hispanic Whites

The cornerstone of VUS management is to base clinical decisions on traditional risk factors until more definitive classification becomes available.

What germline testing strategy is recommended for patients with recurrent breast cancer?,BRCA1/2 testing is recommended regardless of family history for patients who are candidates for PARP inhibitor therapy.,"Based on my review of the information provided, the germline testing strategy recommended for patients with recurrent breast cancer is:

1. All patients with recurrent breast cancer (whether local or metastatic) who are candidates for PARP inhibitor therapy should be offered BRCA1/2 testing, regardless of their family history. This recommendation has a very high agreement rate of 97.50% among experts.

2. BRCA1/2 testing should be offered to patients who develop a second primary breast cancer, whether in the opposite (contralateral) or same (ipsilateral) breast. This recommendation has an agreement rate of 89.74%.

These recommendations are supported by clinical evidence showing that:
- PARP inhibitors improve progression-free survival in metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations
- Patients are more likely to have detectable BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants in the recurrent/secondary setting compared to primary diagnosis
- For patients with second breast cancers, testing for a broader panel of actionable genes is appropriate to account for potential differences in mutations across racial/ethnic groups

The primary purpose of this testing is to guide treatment decisions, particularly regarding the use of PARP inhibitor therapy in appropriate candidates. TERMINATE",breast_cancer_1,breast_cancer_1,TRUE,YES
What HER2 testing criteria should be used to determine eligibility for trastuzumab deruxtecan?,Patients with IHC 1+ or 2+/ISH not-amplified results are eligible; IHC 0 results are currently excluded.,"Based on the provided information, I'll provide a clear summary of the HER2 testing criteria for trastuzumab deruxtecan eligibility:

To be eligible for trastuzumab deruxtecan, patients must have:
1. HER2 IHC 1+ OR
2. HER2 IHC 2+ with ISH non-amplified results

Key points:
- Patients with IHC 0 are NOT eligible
- Testing should follow standard ASCO-CAP guidelines for scoring:
  - IHC 1+: Incomplete membrane staining that is faint/barely perceptible in >10% of tumor cells
  - IHC 2+: Weak to moderate complete membrane staining in >10% of tumor cells

Important testing considerations:
- Use 40x magnification for IHC assessment
- Consider second pathologist review for borderline cases
- Use appropriate controls
- Reports must include specific IHC scores rather than just ""HER2-negative"" status to properly identify eligible patients

What are the best practices for distinguishing HER2 IHC 0 from 1+ results?,"Use standardized ASCO-CAP guidelines, high-power examination, second pathologist review, and careful attention to preanalytic conditions.","I apologize for the technical error. Let me try to answer your question about distinguishing HER2 IHC 0 from 1+ results based on my knowledge of pathology guidelines.

Best practices for distinguishing HER2 IHC 0 from 1+ results include:

1. Scoring criteria:
   - HER2 IHC 0: No staining or membrane staining that is incomplete and is faint/barely perceptible in ≤10% of tumor cells
   - HER2 IHC 1+: Incomplete membrane staining that is faint/barely perceptible in >10% of tumor cells

2. Evaluation techniques:
   - Use high-quality controls for each staining run
   - Evaluate only the invasive component of the tumor
   - Assess membrane staining only (not cytoplasmic)
   - Use high-magnification assessment to confirm faint staining
   - Evaluate the entire slide for heterogeneity

3. Quality assurance:
   - Regular calibration of the IHC testing system
   - Participation in proficiency testing programs
   - Dual review of borderline cases
   - Consider digital imaging to assist in standardization

4. Challenging situations:
   - Edge artifacts should not be considered
   - Crush artifacts may give false results and should be avoided
   - Cytoplasmic granular staining should be ignored
   - In heterogeneous cases, quantify the percentage of cells with each staining pattern

For cases difficult to distinguish between 0 and 1+, some laboratories implement a second review by another pathologist, or consider in situ hybridization testing if the clinical situation warrants further investigation.

"What treatment is recommended for patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer who have progressed on endocrine therapy and have received two prior lines of chemotherapy?","The use of sacituzumab govitecan (SG) is recommended based on evidence from the TROPiCS-02 trial, which demonstrated improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to treatment of physician's choice.","Based on the ASCO Guideline Rapid Recommendation Update, for patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer who have progressed on endocrine therapy and have received at least two prior lines of chemotherapy, the recommended treatment is sacituzumab govitecan (SG).

This recommendation is supported by evidence from the TROPiCS-02 trial, which demonstrated:
- A 34% reduction in risk of progression or death with SG compared to physician's choice chemotherapy
- Improved median progression-free survival (5.5 months vs 4.0 months)
- Statistically significant improvement in overall survival (14.4 months vs 11.2 months)

The guideline classifies this as a strong, evidence-based recommendation with moderate quality evidence, where the benefits outweigh the harms. Key adverse events to monitor include diarrhea, febrile neutropenia, and neutropenic colitis.

"For HER2-low metastatic breast cancer (IHC 1+ or 2+, ISH-negative) previously treated with one chemotherapy, what therapy offers improved survival?","Trastuzumab deruxtecan is recommended, offering a median PFS of 9.9 months and median OS of 23.4 months, based on DESTINY-Breast04 trial findings.","Based on the ASCO guideline rapid recommendation update, for patients with HER2-low metastatic breast cancer (IHC 1+ or 2+, ISH-negative) who have received at least one prior chemotherapy, trastuzumab deruxtecan offers improved survival compared to physician's choice of therapy.

The DESTINY-Breast04 phase III trial demonstrated significant survival benefits:
- Overall survival improved from 16.8 months with physician's choice therapy to 23.4 months with trastuzumab deruxtecan (HR 0.64; P=.0010)
- Progression-free survival improved from 5.1 months to 9.9 months (HR 0.50; P<.0001)

This benefit was consistent across both hormone receptor-positive and hormone receptor-negative subgroups, though hormone receptor-positive patients must also be refractory to endocrine therapy to qualify for this recommendation.

The recommendation for trastuzumab deruxtecan is rated as strong with moderate-quality evidence, with benefits clearly outweighing potential harms, including a 12.1% incidence of drug-related interstitial lung disease. TERMINATE",breast_cancer_5,breast_cancer_5,TRUE,YES
"In patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer and ESR1 mutations detected in ctDNA, what is the preferred therapy after prior CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment?",Elacestrant is recommended as it showed improved PFS compared to standard endocrine therapy in the EMERALD trial.,"Based on the information provided, I can answer your specific question about preferred therapy for patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer and ESR1 mutations detected in ctDNA after prior CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment.

The ASCO guideline update clearly recommends elacestrant as a preferred therapy option for these patients. Elacestrant demonstrated improved progression-free survival compared to standard-of-care endocrine therapy in patients with ESR1 mutations, showing a median PFS of 3.8 months versus 1.9 months for standard therapy, and 6-month PFS rates of 41% versus 19%.

Other acceptable treatment options include:
- Other endocrine therapy (ET) alone
- ET in combination with targeted agents such as:
  * Alpelisib (specifically for patients who also have PIK3CA mutations)
  * Everolimus

These recommendations are particularly based on the EMERALD trial results and received a strong recommendation from the expert panel. It's also worth noting that ESR1 mutation testing should be performed at the time of progression, preferably using blood-based ctDNA testing due to its greater sensitivity.

What considerations are necessary when prescribing trastuzumab deruxtecan for HER2-low metastatic breast cancer?,"Patients should be monitored for interstitial lung disease, which occurred in 12.1% of patients treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan in the DESTINY-Breast04 trial.","Based on the ASCO guideline update, here are the key considerations when prescribing trastuzumab deruxtecan for HER2-low metastatic breast cancer:

1. Patient Eligibility:
   - HER2-low status must be confirmed (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+ with negative ISH)
   - Patients with HER2 IHC 0 are not eligible
   - Patient must have received at least one prior line of chemotherapy for metastatic disease
   - For hormone receptor-positive disease, patients must be endocrine-refractory
   - Can be used for both hormone receptor-positive and negative disease

2. Efficacy Considerations:
   - Offers significant improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival compared to conventional chemotherapy
   - Hormone receptor-positive patients: 10.1 vs 5.4 months median PFS; 23.9 vs 17.5 months median OS
   - Hormone receptor-negative patients: 8.5 vs 2.9 months median PFS; 18.2 vs 8.3 months median OS

3. Safety Monitoring:
   - Regular and vigilant monitoring for interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis, which occurred in 12.1% of patients
   - Awareness of potential severity grades of ILD/pneumonitis, including fatal cases (0.8%)
   - Follow standard guidelines for monitoring other chemotherapy-related toxicities

4. Treatment Context:
   - Strong recommendation based on moderate quality evidence
   - Represents the first HER2-directed therapy showing benefit in HER2-low breast cancer
   - Positioned as an option after standard chemotherapy in the metastatic setting
   - Alternative to traditional chemotherapy options

5. Clinical Decision-Making:
   - Benefits outweigh risks according to ASCO panel assessment
   - Median treatment duration was 8.2 months in the clinical trial
   - Careful consideration of the risk-benefit profile for each individual patient

These considerations help ensure appropriate patient selection, effective monitoring (particularly for lung toxicity), and optimal clinical outcomes when prescribing trastuzumab deruxtecan for HER2-low metastatic breast cancer.

"What are the therapy options for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer with PIK3CA mutations?",Endocrine therapy combined with alpelisib,"I'll review this information and provide a clear answer to your question.

Based on the guidelines for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer with PIK3CA mutations, the primary recommended therapy is:

Alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant for:
- Postmenopausal women and male patients
- Who have received prior endocrine therapy including an aromatase inhibitor
- With or without prior CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment

The treatment sequence generally recommends that patients receive CDK4/6 inhibitors with endocrine therapy before starting alpelisib or everolimus.

For implementation of this therapy:
1. PIK3CA mutation testing should be performed using next-generation sequencing in tumor tissue or cell-free DNA from plasma
2. Baseline metabolic testing (HbA1c and fasting glucose) is required
3. Close monitoring is needed during the first 4 weeks (weekly lab work)
4. Preventive measures for common side effects like rash should be considered
5. Patients with uncontrolled diabetes should not receive alpelisib

This recommendation is evidence-based with high-quality evidence (primarily from the SOLAR-1 trial) showing improved progression-free survival with this combination.

"How effective is elacestrant for ESR1 wild-type tumors in hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer?","Elacestrant is not significantly more effective than standard endocrine therapy for ESR1 wild-type tumors, as demonstrated in the EMERALD trial.","Based on the information provided, elacestrant did not demonstrate significant effectiveness for ESR1 wild-type tumors in hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Specifically:

- For patients without detectable ESR1 mutations, elacestrant did not provide a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival compared to standard-of-care endocrine therapy (Hazard Ratio 0.86; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.19; P = .308)

- This finding was observed in patients who had previously received treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with endocrine therapy and had experienced disease progression after first- or second-line endocrine therapy

For patients with ESR1 wild-type tumors, the recommended treatment options continue to include standard approaches such as fulvestrant, aromatase inhibitors, tamoxifen monotherapy, or endocrine therapy combined with targeted agents like alpelisib (for PIK3CA-mutated tumors) or everolimus.

"For HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer refractory to endocrine therapy, should single-agent chemotherapy or sacituzumab govitecan be offered?","Single-agent chemotherapy is preferred, starting with agents like capecitabine or eribulin","I've reviewed the information provided about treatment options for HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer that is refractory to endocrine therapy.

Based on the ASCO rapid recommendation update, the guidelines specifically address your question:

For HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer patients who are refractory to endocrine therapy, sacituzumab govitecan is recommended, but specifically for those who have already received at least two prior lines of chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

The recommendation is supported by the TROPiCS-02 trial, which demonstrated:
- Improved progression-free survival (5.5 vs 4.0 months)
- Improved overall survival (14.4 vs 11.2 months)
- Higher 6-month and 12-month progression-free survival rates

This is a strong recommendation with moderate quality evidence according to the GRADE assessment.

For patients who have not yet received two prior lines of chemotherapy, the guidelines don't specifically recommend sacituzumab govitecan over single-agent chemotherapy. In such cases, standard single-agent chemotherapy would likely be the appropriate choice based on the current evidence.

"In hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, when should ctDNA testing be performed?","ctDNA testing is recommended at recurrence or progression on endocrine therapy, as ESR1 mutations often emerge under treatment pressure.","Based on the guidelines for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, ctDNA testing should be performed in the following specific circumstances:

1. PIK3CA mutation testing: ctDNA testing in plasma should be performed as first-line testing for patients who are candidates for alpelisib plus fulvestrant therapy. If the plasma test is negative and tumor tissue is available, follow-up tissue testing should be conducted, as this can identify additional patients with PIK3CA mutations. FDA-approved assays should be used for plasma testing.

2. ESR1 mutation testing: The guidelines do not currently recommend routine ESR1 mutation testing via ctDNA to guide therapy, despite data suggesting reduced efficacy of aromatase inhibitors compared to fulvestrant in patients with ESR1 mutations. This remains an area of ongoing research.

3. General monitoring: There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine use of ctDNA to monitor treatment response. Standard clinical evaluation and imaging should remain the primary methods for assessing response and guiding therapy decisions.

The guidelines emphasize that while ctDNA technology holds promise, its validated clinical applications are currently limited primarily to PIK3CA testing for determining alpelisib eligibility in this patient population.

For premenopausal women with node-positive, ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, the recommendations vary based on the number of positive nodes:

1. For those with 1-3 positive nodes:
   - The Oncotype DX test should not be offered to guide decisions for adjuvant systemic chemotherapy
   - Data shows that premenopausal women with 1-3 positive nodes benefit from chemotherapy regardless of their Recurrence Score
   - This recommendation has high-quality evidence with moderate strength of recommendation

2. For those with 4 or more positive nodes:
   - There is insufficient evidence to recommend using Oncotype DX test to guide adjuvant therapy decisions
   - This recommendation is based on informal consensus with moderate strength

The guideline recognizes different treatment implications based on menopausal status, and for premenopausal women with node-positive disease specifically, the evidence suggests they benefit from chemotherapy regardless of genomic assay results.

What are the benefits of adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy in postmenopausal breast cancer patients?,Adjuvant bisphosphonates improve overall survival modestly and reduce risks of bone recurrence and fracture rates.,"Based on my review of the information provided, I can offer a comprehensive answer about the benefits of adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy in postmenopausal breast cancer patients.

The benefits include:

1. Survival improvements:
   - Modest improvement in overall survival (reduction in mortality from 23.5% to 21.1%)
   - Improvement in breast cancer-specific mortality (reduction from 18.0% to 14.7%)

2. Recurrence reduction:
   - Significant reduction in bone recurrence (from 8.8% to 6.6%)
   - No statistically significant improvement in distant recurrence outside bone

3. Bone health benefits:
   - Reduced fracture rates (from 10.3% to 9.1%)
   - Improved bone mineral density
   - The ABCSG-18 trial showed denosumab delayed time to first clinical fracture (5% vs 9.6% at 36 months; 11.1% vs 26.2% at 84 months)

These benefits are consistent across different bisphosphonate classes, treatment schedules and doses, tumor characteristics, and concurrent chemotherapy regimens. However, it's important to note that these benefits are considered modest in absolute terms and are only observed in postmenopausal patients. The actual benefit for an individual patient depends on their specific risk of recurrence, with tools like the NHS PREDICT tool available to help estimate potential benefits.

When considering adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy, the decision should involve discussion of these benefits alongside potential risks, patient preferences, and individual circumstances, particularly for patients with low-risk cancers where the clinical benefit may not be meaningful.

3. Zoledronic Acid (intravenous):
   - Option 1: 4 mg once every 6 months for 3 years, or
   - Option 2: 4 mg once every 3 months for 2 years

Important considerations:
- Zoledronic acid is the most practical option in the US due to limited availability of the oral agents
- Treatment should begin within 3 months of surgery or within 2 months after completing chemotherapy
- These recommendations apply to postmenopausal patients only (natural or therapy-induced)
- Patient preference should guide the choice when multiple options are available
- No clear efficacy differences exist between these agents based on comparative trials

The guideline considers this recommendation to have intermediate evidence quality and moderate strength of recommendation.

Should adjuvant denosumab be used to prevent recurrence in breast cancer?,Denosumab is not recommended as it does not consistently reduce recurrence rates.,"I apologize for the technical error that occurred. Let me try to answer your question about adjuvant denosumab for preventing breast cancer recurrence based on my knowledge.

Based on current evidence, adjuvant denosumab has been studied for its potential to prevent breast cancer recurrence, but results have been mixed and it is not universally recommended as a standard treatment.

The D-CARE trial, which was a large randomized controlled trial, did not show a significant benefit of adjuvant denosumab on disease-free survival in patients with early-stage breast cancer. While denosumab (Xgeva, Prolia) is approved for preventing skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases and for treating osteoporosis, its use specifically as an adjuvant therapy to prevent breast cancer recurrence is not currently supported by strong evidence.

Some guidelines may suggest considering denosumab in specific high-risk populations or in the context of clinical trials, but it is not generally recommended as standard adjuvant therapy for all breast cancer patients.

If you need more specific or updated information about denosumab use in breast cancer, I would recommend consulting recent clinical guidelines from organizations like ASCO, NCCN, or consulting with an oncologist for personalized medical advice. TERMINATE",breast_cancer_8,breast_cancer_8,TRUE,YES

- Routine testing for ESR1 mutations should be performed at recurrence or progression on endocrine therapy (whether given with or without CDK4/6 inhibitor)
- Testing should use Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified assays
- Blood-based circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) testing is preferred due to greater sensitivity
- Testing should be done on blood or tissue obtained at the time of progression
- If not done previously, PIK3CA mutation testing should also be performed alongside ESR1 testing
- Patients whose initial tests are ESR1 wild-type may warrant retesting at subsequent disease progressions

What biomarker testing is advised for metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer with immune checkpoint inhibitor candidates?,Testing for PD-L1 expression in tumor and immune cells is recommended to determine eligibility for pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy.,"Based on the provided information, I can formulate a clear answer:

For metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer patients who are candidates for immune checkpoint inhibitors, PD-L1 testing is the recommended biomarker testing, with two validated testing approaches:

1. Using the Ventana SP142 antibody:
- Measures tumor-infiltrating immune cells
- Positivity defined as ≥1% staining of tumor area

2. Using the FDA-approved 22C3 PD-L1 IHC assay:
- Measures Combined Positive Score (CPS)
- CPS ≥1 is required for eligibility
- Maximum benefit observed in patients with CPS ≥10

It's important to note that these different PD-L1 testing methods correspond to different treatment protocols, and the choice of testing method should align with the planned treatment regimen. PD-L1 testing is particularly important for determining eligibility for first-line immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in triple-negative breast cancer patients.

Should circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) be routinely used to monitor therapy response in metastatic breast cancer?,Routine use of ctDNA for monitoring therapy response is not recommended due to insufficient data.,"Based on the provided information, I can give a clear answer to your question:

No, ctDNA should not be routinely used to monitor therapy response in metastatic breast cancer. This recommendation is based on current clinical guidelines that cite insufficient data to support its routine use. While ctDNA technology shows promise for identifying tumor-specific mutations and detecting mutations in plasma, there is currently:

1. No evidence that using ctDNA changes as a response marker improves patient outcomes
2. No prospective evidence showing that mutation identification through ctDNA to direct therapy improves outcomes compared to standard imaging-based detection

The recommendation against routine use is supported by:
- Low quality evidence
- Moderate strength recommendation
- Informal consensus among experts

Treatment decisions should continue to be based on clinical evaluation, assessment of disease progression/response, and patient goals rather than biomarker results alone. Further research is needed before ctDNA monitoring can be recommended for routine clinical practice in metastatic breast cancer.

Is the use of abemaciclib restricted to patients with a high Ki-67 score?,Abemaciclib is recommended for broader patient populations at high risk of recurrence regardless of Ki-67 status.,"After reviewing the provided information, I can provide a clear answer:

No, the use of abemaciclib is not strictly restricted to patients with high Ki-67 scores, although there are different recommendations based on regulatory and clinical evidence:

1. The FDA-based recommendation is more specific, recommending abemaciclib for patients with Ki-67 scores ≥20%.

2. The broader ITT (Intent-to-Treat) population recommendation allows for use in high-risk patients who meet other criteria, where Ki-67 ≥20% is just one of several possible risk factors. Patients can qualify based on:
- Having ≥4 positive lymph nodes, OR
- Having 1-3 positive lymph nodes plus either:
  * Grade 3 disease
  * Tumor size ≥5 cm

"What is the preferred treatment for triple-negative, PD-L1-negative metastatic breast cancer?",Single-agent chemotherapy is preferred,"After reviewing the provided information, I can provide a clear answer about the preferred treatment for triple-negative, PD-L1-negative metastatic breast cancer:

The preferred first-line treatment is single-agent chemotherapy rather than combination chemotherapy. However, treatment should be individualized based on specific circumstances:

Key points about the treatment approach:

1. Single-agent chemotherapy is the standard approach, but combination chemotherapy may be considered in specific situations:
- When disease is symptomatic
- When disease is immediately life-threatening
- When there may only be one chance for therapy

2. Regarding the choice of chemotherapy:
- Either platinum-based or nonplatinum-based regimens can be used
- The selection should be individualized based on:
  * Patient preferences
  * Risk assessment
  * Benefit evaluation

It's important to note that while platinum-based regimens show similar efficacy (comparable 1-year death rates), they are associated with higher rates of grade 3-4 toxicities, particularly nausea/vomiting and anemia.

This recommendation is supported by moderate-quality evidence and carries a strong recommendation strength, with benefits outweighing potential harms. TERMINATE",breast_cancer_12,breast_cancer_12,TRUE,YES

How should patients with BRAF V600E-mutant mCRC receive after prior chemotherapy?,Encorafenib plus cetuximab is recommended.,"Based on the comprehensive information provided, I can formulate a clear answer to the question:

Patients with BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer who have received prior chemotherapy should be treated with encorafenib plus cetuximab. This is a strong, evidence-based recommendation supported by the BEACON phase III trial, which demonstrated:

1. Significant survival benefits:
- Improved overall survival
- Improved progression-free survival
- Higher objective response rate

2. Better safety profile with fewer grade 3 or greater adverse events compared to control treatment

This combination therapy should be offered to patients whose disease has progressed after at least one previous line of therapy. The recommendation applies to the approximately 8% of mCRC patients who have BRAF V600E mutations, a group that typically has a poorer prognosis.

The guidelines strongly recommend offering either pembrolizumab or nivolumab to patients with platinum-refractory recurrent or metastatic HNSCC, regardless of their CPS (Combined Positive Score) status. This is a strong, evidence-based recommendation with high-quality evidence supporting it.

Key points:
1. This applies to patients who have disease progression within 6 months after platinum-based chemotherapy
2. Both medications are FDA-approved for this indication regardless of PD-L1 expression status
3. Clinical trials showed significant survival benefits:
   - Pembrolizumab: 8.4 months overall survival
   - Nivolumab: 7.5 months overall survival
4. Both treatments showed lower rates of grade 3 and 4 adverse events compared to standard care
5. The survival benefit is independent of HPV status or PD-L1 expression

What is the recommendation for PD-L1 biomarker testing in recurrent/metastatic HNSCC?,"PD-L1 immunohistochemistry testing is recommended, and a CPS ≥1 is considered positive for PD-1 inhibitor therapy.","Based on the provided information, I can formulate a clear answer regarding PD-L1 biomarker testing recommendations in recurrent/metastatic HNSCC:

PD-L1 immunohistochemistry testing is strongly recommended for patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC (high quality evidence). The specific recommendations are:

1. Testing should be performed using Combined Positive Score (CPS) as the preferred scoring method
2. A CPS ≥ 1 should be interpreted as positive
3. Testing should be completed before initiating first-line therapy to guide treatment selection between:
   - Pembrolizumab monotherapy
   - Pembrolizumab + chemotherapy
   - Chemotherapy alone

The CPS method calculates the number of PD-L1 positive tumor cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages divided by total tumor cells x 100. This lower threshold (CPS ≥ 1) is preferred over higher cutoffs to maximize sensitivity and is strongly correlated with clinical benefit to PD-1 inhibitors.

1. For BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (germline or somatic):
- Olaparib: 300 mg twice daily for 2 years
- Niraparib: 200-300 mg daily for 3 years
- Rucaparib: 600 mg twice daily for 2 years

2. For HRD positive patients (using FDA-approved testing):
- Rucaparib or niraparib are recommended

3. For BRCA wild-type/HRD negative patients:
- Niraparib or rucaparib may be offered

Extended treatment duration beyond these timeframes may be considered for select patients after discussing risks and benefits.

These recommendations are supported by high-quality evidence and carry a strong strength of recommendation, specifically for high-grade serous or endometrioid ovarian cancer patients. TERMINATE",gynecologic_cancer_1,gynecologic_cancer_1,TRUE,YES
What is the effect of PARP inhibitors on patients' overall survival in recurrent ovarian cancer without BRCA-mutation or HRD-positivity?,Evidence suggests potential overall survival detriments in later-line treatments with PARP inhibitors,"Based on the provided information, I can formulate a clear answer about the effect of PARP inhibitors (specifically niraparib) on overall survival in recurrent ovarian cancer patients without BRCA mutations:

The evidence suggests a potentially negative effect on overall survival in these patients:

1. In non-BRCA mutant patients:
- Median OS was actually shorter with niraparib (31.1 months) compared to placebo (36.5 months)
- Hazard ratio of 1.10 (95% CI, 0.83 to 1.46) indicates a trend toward worse survival

2. In non-BRCA mutant/HRD-positive subgroup:
- Similar negative trend with median OS of 37.3 months for niraparib vs 41.4 months for placebo
- Hazard ratio of 1.32 (95% CI, 0.84 to 2.06) suggests a possible survival detriment

These findings have led to clinical recommendations that healthcare providers should carefully weigh the progression-free survival benefits against the potential overall survival detriment when considering niraparib maintenance therapy in these patient populations. However, it's important to note that these results should be interpreted with caution due to study limitations including:
- The study not being powered for OS analysis
- High rates of crossover
- Missing data
- Statistical design considerations (one-sided α-level of 0.025)

What is the effect of PARP inhibitors on patients' progression-free survival in recurrent ovarian cancer without BRCA-mutation or HRD-positivity?,PARP inhibitors demonstrated progression-free survival benefits,"Based on the provided information, I can formulate a clear answer about the effect of PARP inhibitors on PFS in non-BRCA mutated/non-HRD positive recurrent ovarian cancer:

PARP inhibitors do show a modest improvement in progression-free survival for these patients. Specifically, the ATHENA-MONO trial demonstrated that rucaparib maintenance therapy extended median PFS to 12.1 months compared to 9.1 months with placebo in HRD-negative patients (HR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.45-0.95). However, this PFS benefit must be carefully weighed against important safety concerns:

1. There are emerging safety signals showing potential overall survival detriments in some studies
2. The evidence quality for using PARP inhibitors in this population is considered ""low""
3. These agents should only be considered for maintenance therapy (not treatment) in patients who:
   - Have not previously received a PARP inhibitor
   - Have responded to platinum-based therapy

The current recommendation emphasizes that treatment decisions should be individualized, with careful consideration of the risk-benefit ratio for each patient. TERMINATE",gynecologic_cancer_1,gynecologic_cancer_1,TRUE,YES
What surgical approach is recommended for T3-T4 parotid cancers with high-grade malignancy?,"At least a superficial parotidectomy, with consideration of total or subtotal parotidectomy.","Based on the pdf viewer's response, I can provide a clear answer to your question about the surgical approach for T3-T4 parotid cancers with high-grade malignancy:

The recommended surgical approach consists of multiple key components:

1. Primary Surgery:
- Minimum of superficial parotidectomy
- Total or subtotal parotidectomy should be considered

2. Mandatory Neck Management:
- Ipsilateral selective neck dissection (levels II-IV)
- This is required even for clinically negative neck (cN0) due to high risk of occult nodal disease

3. Facial Nerve Management:
- Preserve if nerve function is intact and a dissection plane exists
- Resect involved nerve branches if:
   * Preoperative facial weakness is present
   * Nerve is encased/grossly involved by tumor

4. Surgical Margins:
- Complete surgical resection with negative margins is the goal
- Close margins may be accepted when anatomically constrained

The approach should be individualized and discussed in a multidisciplinary tumor board, with consideration for subsequent adjuvant therapy. The surgical planning must balance maximum oncologic control with functional preservation where safely possible. TERMINATE",headneck_cancer_3,headneck_cancer_3,TRUE,YES
What is the recommended follow-up imaging schedule for high-grade salivary gland cancers post-treatment?,"Baseline imaging at 3 months, every 6-12 months for the first 2 years, and symptom-directed imaging from years 3-5. Yearly chest CT may be considered for high-grade cases.","Based on my review of the pdf_viewer's output, I can provide a clear and comprehensive answer about the follow-up imaging schedule for high-grade salivary gland cancers post-treatment:

The recommended imaging schedule follows a systematic, risk-adapted approach:

1. At 3 months post-treatment:
- Baseline imaging with contrast CT or MRI of the primary site and/or PET/CT

2. First 2 years:
- Every 6-12 months: Contrast CT or MRI of primary site and chest CT

3. Years 3-5:
- Imaging guided by symptoms and physical examination
- Optional yearly imaging for high-grade cases
- Chest CT and primary site imaging as clinically indicated

4. After 5 years:
- Annual follow-up examinations
- Optional yearly chest CT, particularly for high-grade cases

Important considerations:
- More frequent surveillance is recommended in the initial period
- High-grade histology cases warrant more intensive long-term monitoring
- Both primary site and chest should be monitored due to metastasis risk
- Choice between CT and MRI depends on individual patient factors and accessibility

What radiotherapy technique is preferred for stage II-IVA nasopharyngeal carcinoma?,Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with daily image guidance is strongly recommended.,"Based on the comprehensive information provided, I can give a clear answer about the preferred radiotherapy technique for stage II-IVA nasopharyngeal carcinoma:

IMRT (Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy) with daily image guidance is the preferred radiotherapy technique for stage II-IVA nasopharyngeal carcinoma. This recommendation is based on high-quality evidence showing that IMRT:
- Reduces toxicity (including neurotoxicity, xerostomia, trismus, and dysphagia)
- Enhances disease control and survival compared to 2D/3D radiotherapy
- Should be delivered with a prescribed dose of 70 Gy in 33-35 fractions over 7 weeks

What is the role of adjuvant chemotherapy for T3N0 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients?,"Adjuvant chemotherapy may be offered, typically using a PF regimen.","Based on the provided information, I can formulate a clear answer about the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in T3N0 nasopharyngeal carcinoma:

Adjuvant chemotherapy plays an optional rather than mandatory role in T3N0 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients. The key points are:

1. The primary treatment should be concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

2. Adjuvant chemotherapy may be offered but is not mandatory because:
- T3N0 patients have a relatively lower risk of treatment failure compared to other locally advanced cases
- This specific subgroup was excluded from several key randomized controlled trials
- There is limited dedicated trial data for this patient population

3. If adjuvant chemotherapy is chosen, the recommended regimens are:
- PF regimen: cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil every 4 weeks for 3 cycles
- For cisplatin-unsuitable patients: carboplatin (AUC 5) with 5-fluorouracil
- Non-platinum regimens should be avoided outside clinical trials

4. The decision to use adjuvant chemotherapy should be individualized based on patient-specific factors and requires a thorough discussion of potential benefits and risks with the patient.

Should osimertinib be recommended for stage IB NSCLC with tumors ≥4 cm with EGFR mutation?,Adjuvant osimertinib may be considered,"After reviewing the information, I can provide a clear answer:

Yes, osimertinib should be recommended for stage IB NSCLC with tumors ≥4 cm with EGFR mutations (Ex19del or L858R). This is supported by a strong recommendation with high-quality evidence in the guidelines (Recommendation 1.2).

Key points to consider:
1. The recommendation specifically applies to patients with sensitizing EGFR mutations
2. A postoperative multimodality evaluation, including consultation with a medical oncologist, is required to assess individual benefits and risks
3. The benefits are particularly notable for patients with larger tumors
4. Clinical trial data showed significant improvement in disease-free survival at 24 months (89% vs 52%) for patients receiving osimertinib compared to placebo

Important note: Adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy and/or atezolizumab are not recommended for routine use in this patient group.

What is the recommended neoadjuvant therapy for resectable stage III NSCLC with N2 disease?,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy or concurrent chemoradiation,"Based on the provided information, I can formulate a clear answer to your question:

For resectable stage III NSCLC with N2 disease, there is a strong recommendation (with high-quality evidence) for patients to receive either:
1. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone, OR
2. Neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiation

However, neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone is generally preferred because:
- There is no demonstrated significant survival benefit of adding radiation therapy
- Studies show high compliance rates (90%) with neoadjuvant chemotherapy
- It provides key benefits including:
  - Tumor size reduction
  - Increased operability
  - Early treatment of micrometastases
  - Ability to assess treatment efficacy

This recommendation is supported by meta-analyses showing a 13% reduction in death risk with preoperative chemotherapy compared to surgery alone, and evidence of improved mediastinal downstaging and R0 resection rates. TERMINATE",lung_cancer_6,lung_cancer_6,TRUE,YES
What is the management for stage III NSCLC that is medically inoperable?,Concurrent chemoradiation is recommended as the definitive therapy,"After reviewing the pdf_viewer output, I can provide a clear answer regarding the management of medically inoperable stage III NSCLC:

The standard management consists of the following key components:

1. Primary Treatment:
- First choice: Concurrent chemoradiation therapy with:
  * Radiation dose of 60 Gy (up to 70 Gy in select cases)
  * Platinum-based doublet chemotherapy using one of these regimens:
    - Cisplatin plus etoposide
    - Carboplatin plus paclitaxel
    - Cisplatin plus pemetrexed (for non-squamous)
    - Cisplatin plus vinorelbine

2. Alternative Approach:
- For patients who cannot tolerate concurrent therapy: Sequential chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy is recommended over radiation alone

3. Consolidation Therapy:
- After completing concurrent chemoradiation without disease progression, patients should receive durvalumab for up to 12 months

The treatment selection should be individualized based on:
- Patient's performance status
- Ability to tolerate concurrent therapy
- Radiation dose constraints to critical organs
- Multidisciplinary team assessment

What is the evidence-based radiation dose for stage III NSCLC treated with chemoradiation?,A dose of 60 Gy in conventional fractionation is recommended for concurrent chemoradiation.,"After reviewing the provided information, I can provide a clear evidence-based answer regarding radiation dose for stage III NSCLC treated with chemoradiation:

The standard evidence-based radiation dose is 60 Gy given with concurrent chemotherapy. This is supported by Level 1 evidence and carries a strong recommendation. This dose was established by RTOG 7301 and definitively validated in RTOG 0617, which demonstrated:
- Superior median survival with 60 Gy (28.7 months) compared to 74 Gy (20.3 months)
- Better 5-year overall survival rates (32.1% vs 23%) favoring 60 Gy

While 60 Gy is the standard, doses between 60-70 Gy may be considered for selected patients with careful attention to normal tissue constraints (heart, lungs, and esophagus). However, doses above 70 Gy are not recommended outside of clinical trials due to evidence of increased toxicity without survival benefit.

Important note: If concurrent chemotherapy cannot be given, alternative fractionation schemes using 2.15-4 Gy per fraction may be considered. TERMINATE",lung_cancer_6,lung_cancer_6,TRUE,YES
What is the length of consolidation immunotherapy for patients with stage III NSCLC finished chemoradiation?,Consolidation durvalumab for up to 12 months is recommended,"Based on the comprehensive information provided, I can provide a clear answer to your question:

For patients with stage III NSCLC who have completed concurrent chemoradiation, the recommended length of consolidation immunotherapy is up to 12 months (1 year) with durvalumab. This recommendation is well-supported by the PACIFIC trial, which demonstrated significant survival benefits including improved progression-free survival and overall survival with this duration of treatment.

"For patients with resected stage III NSCLC and EGFR mutation, should adjuvant chemotherapy still be offered?","Yes, platinum-based chemotherapy should be offered before osimertinib","Based on the pdf viewer's output, I can provide a clear answer to your question:

Yes, adjuvant chemotherapy should still be offered to patients with resected stage III NSCLC and EGFR mutation. Specifically:

1. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is recommended as the FIRST treatment for these patients.

2. After completing chemotherapy, these patients should then receive adjuvant osimertinib if they have sensitizing EGFR mutations (Ex19del or L858R).

3. These patients should NOT receive adjuvant atezolizumab, even if they have PD-L1 ≥ 1%.

This recommendation is supported by high-quality evidence and has a strong strength of recommendation from the ASCO guideline panel. The sequential approach of chemotherapy followed by osimertinib has shown significant disease-free survival benefit (HR 0.17, p<0.001) in clinical trials, although overall survival data is still immature.

The recommended therapy consists of both neoadjuvant and adjuvant approaches:

Neoadjuvant Therapy:
- First-line recommendation is pembrolizumab: 3 courses of 200 mg every 3 weeks before resection
- Where possible, patients should be offered enrollment in clinical trials

After Resection (Adjuvant Therapy):
1. For patients who received neoadjuvant pembrolizumab:
- Continue with adjuvant pembrolizumab for up to 15 courses (200 mg every 3 weeks)

2. For stage IV disease, several options are available:
- Nivolumab monotherapy
- Nivolumab plus ipilimumab followed by nivolumab
- Pembrolizumab monotherapy
- Dabrafenib plus trametinib (specifically for BRAF V600E/K mutations)

What therapy should be avoided in BRAF-mutant unresectable melanoma after progression on anti-PD-1?,Ipilimumab-containing regimens should be avoided after progression on other therapies.,"Based on the provided information, I can give a clear answer:

In BRAF-mutant unresectable melanoma that has progressed on anti-PD-1 therapy, ipilimumab and ipilimumab-containing regimens should be avoided. Instead, these patients should be switched to BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy. This recommendation is based on recent evidence from trials like DREAMseq and SECOMBIT that support the superiority of using BRAF/MEK inhibitors in this sequence rather than ipilimumab-based treatments.

What are the therapy options for metastatic uveal melanoma for HLA-A*02:01-positive patients?,Tebentafusp is recommended for HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.,"Based on the provided information, I can provide a clear answer regarding therapy options for HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with metastatic uveal melanoma:

The primary recommended treatment is tebentafusp, which should be administered according to the following specific dosing schedule:
- Day 1: 20 μg (single dose)
- Day 8: 30 μg (single dose)
- Thereafter: 68 μg once weekly until disease progression

This recommendation is strongly supported by clinical evidence from the Nathan 2021 trial, which demonstrated:
1. Significant improvement in overall survival (HR 0.51)
2. Better progression-free survival (HR 0.73)
3. Higher disease control rate compared to alternative treatments

While the treatment initially has substantial grade 3-4 adverse events, these become more manageable over time, and the benefits outweigh the risks. Importantly, this treatment can be used in both previously treated and untreated patients.

Alternative treatments that were used in the control group of the trial included:
- Pembrolizumab
- Ipilimumab
- Dacarbazine

However, tebentafusp showed superior outcomes compared to these alternatives. TERMINATE",melanoma_cancer_1,melanoma_cancer_1,TRUE,YES

The recommended radiation dose is:
- Single-fraction SRS of 20-24 Gy (2,000-2,400 cGy)

If multifraction SRS is required (such as when V12Gy > 10 cm3), alternative options include:
- 27 Gy (2,700 cGy) in three fractions, or
- 30 Gy (3,000 cGy) in five fractions

When is tumor size cutoff that surgery is preferred over SRS for brain metastases?,Surgery is conditionally recommended for brain metastases over 4 cm.,"Based on the provided information, I can give a clear answer:

Generally, the size cutoff where surgery is preferred over SRS for brain metastases is around 3-4 cm in diameter. Specifically, SRS is typically recommended for tumors less than 3-4 cm, while surgery is usually preferred for larger tumors, especially those causing mass effect. However, it's important to note that this is not a strict rule, as the decision between surgery and SRS should be individualized and takes into account multiple factors including:
- Need for tissue diagnosis
- Presence of multiple vs single metastases
- Overall systemic disease status
- Patient's performance status
- Ability to tolerate surgery

The decision should ultimately be made on a case-by-case basis through discussion between the patient and the multidisciplinary medical team. TERMINATE",neurooncology_cancer_2,neurooncology_cancer_2,TRUE,YES
"For asymptomatic brain metastases from EGFR-mutant NSCLC, should local therapy be offered?",Local therapy delayed until intracranial progression after osimertinib,"Based on the provided information, I can give a clear answer to your question:

For asymptomatic brain metastases from EGFR-mutant NSCLC, local therapy can be delayed (not offered immediately) under specific conditions:

1. If the patient is being treated with osimertinib or icotinib
2. The patient must be carefully monitored for intracranial progression
3. Local therapy should be initiated if there is evidence of disease progression

This recommendation is based on:
- The demonstrated CNS activity of these targeted agents (particularly osimertinib showing 66% intracranial response rate)
- A weak recommendation with low-quality evidence
- Requires careful patient selection and multidisciplinary discussion

Important notes:
- This is one of the few scenarios where deferring local therapy is specifically recommended
- The decision requires careful monitoring and shared decision-making
- Local therapy remains an important option if progression occurs

What is the number of brain mets that SRS be chosen over WBRT for unresected brain metastases?,SRS alone is recommended for 1-4 unresected brain metastases.,"Based on the pdf_viewer output, I can provide a clear answer regarding the number of brain metastases for which SRS should be chosen over WBRT:

For unresected brain metastases, SRS is:
- Strongly recommended for 1-4 brain metastases in patients with ECOG performance status 0-2 (high-quality evidence)
- Conditionally recommended for 5-10 brain metastases in patients with ECOG performance status 0-2 (low-quality evidence)

The guidance shows a clear preference for SRS over WBRT particularly in the 1-4 metastases range, where the evidence quality and strength of recommendation are both high. While SRS can still be considered for 5-10 metastases, the recommendation is weaker and based on lower quality evidence. TERMINATE",neurooncology_cancer_1,neurooncology_cancer_1,TRUE,YES
Should radiation therapy be offered to patients with KPS ≤ 50 and brain metastases?,Radiation therapy is not recommended for patients with KPS ≤ 50.,"Based on the provided information from the guidelines, I can formulate a clear answer:

For patients with KPS ≤ 50 and brain metastases, the guidelines do not explicitly recommend radiation therapy. Instead, they emphasize:

1. Early introduction of palliative care for symptom management and caregiver support
2. Supportive care only (without WBRT) should be considered as a primary option
3. If WBRT is used in poor prognosis patients, brief schedules (such as five fractions) are preferred

The guidelines suggest a more conservative approach focusing on supportive and palliative care rather than aggressive radiation treatment for patients with poor performance status. This aligns with the goal of maintaining quality of life and providing appropriate symptom management for these vulnerable patients.

When toxicity is a concern for patients with oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant, 1p19q codeleted, WHO grade 2, there are three main alternative treatment options:

1. Temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy: This is a reasonable alternative to standard PCV chemotherapy, though this recommendation is considered ""weak"" with ""low"" quality evidence.

2. Treatment deferral: In select patients with favorable prognostic factors (complete tumor resection and younger age), initial therapy may be delayed until there is evidence of progression.

3. Radiation therapy (54 Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks) with adjuvant chemotherapy.

Based on the provided information from the document, there is no specific recommendation for HER2 mutations in the first-line treatment setting. The document mentions trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) as an option, but specifically notes this is for second-line therapy and beyond, not first-line.

The guideline explicitly states: ""Treatment decisions based on HER2 overexpression are restricted to second line and beyond.""

For first-line therapy in patients with HER2-mutated NSCLC, the document does not provide a specific recommendation. It appears that for patients without applicable targeted therapy options in the first line, the guideline suggests following the non-driver alteration guideline, which would typically include platinum-based chemotherapy combinations (such as carboplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab).

Therefore, based on this guideline, carboplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab would likely be the appropriate first-line option, with T-DXd reserved for second-line treatment in patients with HER2 mutations. TERMINATE",NCCN_NSCLC,lung_cancer_1,FALSE,YES (human)

Based on the ASCO Living Guideline for Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer With Driver Alterations (Version 2024.2), there is no specific recommendation regarding the use of T-DM1 after progression on T-DXd (trastuzumab deruxtecan). The guideline only mentions that trastuzumab deruxtecan may be offered for HER2 mutations (Recommendation 2.17), but does not address subsequent therapy options after progression on this agent.

The guideline does not provide guidance on sequencing of HER2-targeted therapies or specifically address the use of a second antibody-drug conjugate (T-DM1) after progression on a first antibody-drug conjugate (T-DXd). For patients who have exhausted targeted options, the guideline generally recommends following the non-driver alteration guideline for subsequent therapy.

Therefore, based on this specific guideline, there is insufficient evidence to make a clear recommendation about using T-DM1 after progression on T-DXd in HER2-mutated NSCLC patients.

The document is an ASCO guideline update focused on other treatments for HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, but does not include information about this specific trial or drug.

To provide an accurate answer about whether datopotamab deruxtecan met the primary outcome of improved overall survival in the TROPION-BREAST01 trial, we would need to reference different documentation that specifically discusses this trial's results. The current document does not contain this information.

"For patients with isolated extramedullary disease of AML, aka myeloid sarcoma, is radiation threapy sufficient to achieve long-term remission?","no, RT can be used for residual disease or debulk, where systemic therapy is needed","After reviewing the information provided, I can see that there is no specific ASCO guideline in the available database that addresses the management of myeloid sarcoma (isolated extramedullary disease of AML). 

To answer your specific question about whether radiation therapy alone is sufficient to achieve long-term remission in myeloid sarcoma, I cannot provide an evidence-based answer from ASCO guidelines as they don't appear to have specific recommendations on this topic.

For authoritative guidance on this specific clinical question, you would need to consult other resources such as:

1. National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines on AML
2. American Society of Hematology (ASH) resources and guidelines
3. Specific AML treatment guidelines that address extramedullary disease management

These resources would contain the most current evidence-based recommendations regarding radiation therapy's role and efficacy in achieving long-term remission for isolated myeloid sarcoma. TERMINATE",NCCN_AML,,FALSE,YES (human)
"For patients with multiple myeloma who are not a candidate for autologous stem cell transplant, should quadruple therapy be still offered if patients are not frail?","yes, dara-RVD is a acceptable option","After reviewing the available information, I don't have sufficient evidence from ASCO guidelines to answer your specific question about quadruple therapy for non-frail multiple myeloma patients who are not candidates for autologous stem cell transplant.

The search conducted did not find any ASCO guidelines specifically addressing multiple myeloma treatment approaches, including quadruple therapy regimens or transplant-ineligible patient management. 

For evidence-based recommendations on this clinical scenario, I would suggest consulting other authoritative sources that provide specific guidance on multiple myeloma treatment, such as:

1. National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for multiple myeloma
2. International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) recommendations
3. European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines
4. American Society of Hematology (ASH) resources

These organizations regularly publish updated treatment guidelines that include specific recommendations for transplant-ineligible patients and address the role of triplet versus quadruplet regimens based on patient characteristics like frailty status.

"For patietns with large B-cell lymphoma, who relapsed at 15 months after finishing frontline R-CHOP, is CAR T-cell therapy an option?","no, CAR T-cell therapy is indicated as second line if relapse < 12 months","I need to analyze information about treatment options for large B-cell lymphoma patients who relapsed 15 months after R-CHOP therapy. However, I don't have access to a PDF document with the relevant information.

To properly answer your question about whether CAR T-cell therapy is an option for patients with large B-cell lymphoma who relapsed 15 months after frontline R-CHOP, I would need to review current clinical guidelines and literature.

Based on general medical knowledge, CAR T-cell therapy has emerged as a treatment option for relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma, but specific eligibility criteria, timing after relapse, and placement in the treatment algorithm would depend on current guidelines, the patient's specific characteristics, and availability of the therapy.

For a definitive answer, I would recommend:

1. Consulting the latest NCCN or other lymphoma treatment guidelines
2. Discussing with a hematologist-oncologist who specializes in lymphoma
3. Reviewing specific CAR T-cell therapy approval criteria for relapsed LBCL

Without access to specific guidelines in a PDF, I cannot provide a more detailed answer at this time. TERMINATE",NCCN_lymphoma,,FALSE,YES (human)
What is the preferred front treatment for stage III diffuse large B-cell lymphoma if IPI=1?,RCHOP,"I've reviewed the output from the PDF viewer, and unfortunately, the document doesn't contain specific information about the preferred front-line treatment for stage III diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with an IPI score of 1.

The ASCO guidelines available in the document cover various cancer types including breast, lung, gastrointestinal, melanoma, head and neck, gynecologic, genitourinary, and neuro-oncology cancers, but there are no lymphoma-specific guidelines included.

For accurate information on this specific clinical scenario, you would need to consult other authoritative sources such as:
- National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for B-cell lymphomas
- American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines
- Other specialized lymphoma treatment guidelines from relevant professional organizations

These sources would provide the current standard of care for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with your specific parameters. TERMINATE",NCCN_lymphoma,,FALSE,YES (human)
"Should patients with newly diagnosed Ph-negative B-cell ALL considered for allogeneic stem cell transplantation, if they have TCF3::PBX1 translocation?","no, t(1;19) translocation is considered standard risk B-ALL and transplantation is not recommended. ","I've reviewed the outputs from the pdf_viewer and it appears that the ASCO guidelines available do not contain specific recommendations regarding allogeneic stem cell transplantation for patients with newly diagnosed Ph-negative B-cell ALL with TCF3::PBX1 translocation.

To properly answer your question, you would need to consult other authoritative sources such as:

1. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for ALL
2. American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines
3. Recent peer-reviewed literature on outcomes for patients with TCF3::PBX1 translocation

The TCF3::PBX1 (also known as E2A-PBX1) translocation is a specific genetic aberration that may have particular prognostic implications that would inform transplantation decisions, but this information is not available in the current ASCO guidelines that were searched.

For an evidence-based recommendation regarding your specific question, please consult these alternative resources or discuss with a hematologist-oncologist who specializes in ALL treatment.
