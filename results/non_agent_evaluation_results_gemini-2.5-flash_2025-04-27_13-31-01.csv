The specific regimen depends on histology (squamous vs. non-squamous).",NO
What are the options for patients with stage IV NSCLC with squamous histology and PD-L1 TPS ≥50%?,"Single-agent pembrolizumab, cemiplimab, or atezolizumab, or combination with chemotherapy, may be offered.","The main first-line options are:

Should osimertinib be recommended for stage IB NSCLC with tumors ≥4 cm with EGFR mutation?,Adjuvant osimertinib may be considered,"This scenario is based on an inconsistency in TNM staging. Stage IB NSCLC (T2a N0 M0) is defined by a tumor size of ≤4 cm. A tumor ≥4 cm would place the stage as at least IIA (T2b N0 M0) or higher.

Osimertinib is recommended as adjuvant therapy for resected Stage IB-IIIA (T2a/T2b N0 M0 included, where T2a≤4cm and T2b >4cm) NSCLC with EGFR mutation.

Therefore, while osimertinib *is* recommended for resected Stage IIA (which would include tumors ≥4 cm) with EGFR mutation, the premise of Stage IB with a tumor ≥4 cm is not consistent with current staging guidelines.",NO

When is tumor size cutoff that surgery is preferred over SRS for brain metastases?,Surgery is conditionally recommended for brain metastases over 4 cm.,Surgery is generally preferred over SRS for brain metastases larger than **~3 cm**.,NO
"For asymptomatic brain metastases from EGFR-mutant NSCLC, should local therapy be offered?",Local therapy delayed until intracranial progression after osimertinib,"Yes, local therapy, particularly stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), is frequently offered and is a standard management option for asymptomatic brain metastases from EGFR-mutant NSCLC.

While initial treatment with systemic EGFR TKIs alone is also a valid approach for some patients with asymptomatic lesions, local therapy provides durable control and is part of a multidisciplinary management strategy. The decision depends on factors like the number, size, and location of metastases, as well as patient preference.",NO

Other approaches often explored are **complementary therapies** (like specific diets or supplements), but their direct efficacy against the tumor is largely unproven and should be discussed with the medical team due to potential interactions.",NO
