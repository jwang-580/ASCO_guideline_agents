What are the therapy options for metastatic uveal melanoma for HLA-A*02:01-positive patients?,Tebentafusp is recommended for HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.,"For HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with metastatic uveal melanoma, tebentafusp, a bispecific T-cell receptor therapy, is a key treatment option. Other therapies may include immune checkpoint inhibitors, liver-directed therapies, and clinical trials exploring novel agents.","For HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with metastatic uveal melanoma, key therapy options include:

1. IMCgp100/tebentafusp (first-line treatment) - a bispecific fusion protein targeting gp100 and CD3
2. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., pembrolizumab, ipilimumab)
3. Clinical trials testing novel immunotherapies
4. Conventional treatments like chemotherapy or liver-directed therapies

Tebentafusp is particularly important as it's specifically approved for HLA-A*02:01-positive patients and has shown improved overall survival.",YES,YES
What radiation dose is suggested for brain metastases less than 2 cm in size?,Single-fraction SRS with 2000-2400 cGy is recommended.,"For brain metastases less than 2 cm in size, a stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) dose of **24 Gy in a single fraction** is commonly recommended.","For brain metastases less than 2 cm in size, a typical stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) dose of 18-24 Gy in a single fraction is commonly recommended.",YES,YES
When is tumor size cutoff that surgery is preferred over SRS for brain metastases?,Surgery is conditionally recommended for brain metastases over 4 cm.,"Surgery is generally preferred over Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases when the tumor size exceeds 3-4 cm, as larger tumors may cause significant mass effect or edema that requires surgical decompression.","Generally, surgery is preferred over Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases when the tumor is larger than 3-4 cm in diameter, though individual cases may vary based on location and other factors.",YES,YES
"For asymptomatic brain metastases from EGFR-mutant NSCLC, should local therapy be offered?",Local therapy delayed until intracranial progression after osimertinib,"Yes, local therapy (e.g., stereotactic radiosurgery) can be considered for asymptomatic brain metastases from EGFR-mutant NSCLC, but systemic therapy with EGFR TKIs is often prioritized initially due to their efficacy in controlling both systemic and CNS disease.","For asymptomatic brain metastases in EGFR-mutant NSCLC, systemic EGFR-TKI therapy alone is typically recommended as first-line treatment, without immediate local therapy. Local therapy (radiation) can be reserved for if/when there's progression or symptoms develop, as EGFR-TKIs often have good CNS penetration and efficacy.",NO,YES
What is the number of brain mets that SRS be chosen over WBRT for unresected brain metastases?,SRS alone is recommended for 1-4 unresected brain metastases.,"Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is generally preferred over whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) for patients with up to 4 unresected brain metastases, based on current guidelines and evidence.","For patients with 1-4 brain metastases, SRS (Stereotactic Radiosurgery) is generally preferred over WBRT (Whole Brain Radiation Therapy) as first-line treatment for unresected brain metastases, based on better cognitive outcomes and similar survival rates.",YES,YES
Should radiation therapy be offered to patients with KPS ≤ 50 and brain metastases?,Radiation therapy is not recommended for patients with KPS ≤ 50.,"Radiation therapy is generally not recommended for patients with a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≤ 50 and brain metastases, as the potential benefits are often outweighed by the risks and poor prognosis. However, decisions should be individualized based on factors like symptom control and patient preferences.","Generally, radiation therapy is not recommended for patients with KPS ≤ 50 and brain metastases, as these patients have very poor prognosis and limited life expectancy. Best supportive care is usually the more appropriate option.",NO,YES
"What is the alternative treatment for oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant, 1p19q codeleted, CNS WHO grade 2, due to toxicity concerns?",Temozolimide ,"An alternative treatment for oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant, 1p19q codeleted, CNS WHO grade 2, in cases of toxicity concerns may include **radiation therapy alone** or **temozolomide monotherapy**, depending on the patient's condition and physician's assessment.","The main alternative treatment for grade 2 IDH-mutant, 1p19q codeleted oligodendroglioma when standard chemotherapy (typically PCV or temozolomide) cannot be used due to toxicity is radiation therapy alone. However, treatment decisions should be individualized based on patient factors and tumor characteristics.",NO,NO
